# Fashion MNIST Classification

This repository contains code for performing image classification on the Fashion MNIST dataset using various machine learning or deep learning techniques.

## Dataset
The Fashion MNIST dataset is a collection of 28x28 grayscale images of 10 different clothing items. It serves as a drop-in replacement for the original MNIST dataset and is commonly used for benchmarking computer vision algorithms.

## Objective
The objective of this project is to develop models that accurately classify the clothing images into their respective categories. The categories include items such as T-shirts/tops, trousers, pullovers, dresses, coats, sandals, shirts, sneakers, bags, and ankle boots.

## Files Included
- `FashionMNIST.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing code for training and evaluating various machine learning or deep learning models on the Fashion MNIST dataset.


## Techniques Used
- **Machine Learning Algorithms**: This project may explore traditional machine learning algorithms such as Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forests, or k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN).
- **Deep Learning (Neural Networks)**: Implementations of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) using frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch might be utilized for superior performance.

## Instructions
1. **Dataset Preparation**: Ensure the dataset is downloaded or linked properly within the repository.
2. **Dependencies**: Install necessary libraries such as TensorFlow, Keras, Scikit-learn, or other relevant frameworks.
3. **Exploration and Training**: Run the `FashionMNIST.ipynb` notebook to explore the dataset, preprocess the images, train different models, and evaluate their performance.
4. **Model Selection and Evaluation**: Compare the performance metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, etc.) of different models and choose the one with the best performance.
5. **Deployment or Further Analysis**: Utilize the chosen model for predictions, deployment in applications, or conduct further analysis on misclassified images or model interpretability.
